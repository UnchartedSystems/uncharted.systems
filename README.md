# uncharted.systems

This is the repo for uncharted.systems, a slow blog focused on interactive models, emergent behavior, and game design. It used to be powered by [Oboe](https://github.com/kmaasrud/oboe) to convert Obsidian markdown pages into html, but since Oboe has been abandoned, I need to transition the website into using another markdown powered blogging framework, or roll my own.
